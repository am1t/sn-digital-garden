# Hi, I am Amit! 👋🏽

## Welcome to my second brain 🌱

You've stumbled onto the repository for [my wiki](https://wiki.amitg.net). There are other trending names for such a space, [[digital garden]] 🌱 or second brain 🧠. So, call it what you like. I use this site for capturing my unformed throughts, scribbles if you like, and hence the title.

<p style="padding: 20px; background: #f5f7ff; border-radius: 4px;">
  Take a look at <span style="font-weight: bold">[my first note]()</span> to see where I started with this space.
</p>

This space is where I plan to share my notes across all my projects or my thoughts on what I read or watch. Most of what I write here would hardly have any structured, these are thoughts as they arrive. So expect some broken links for things I am yet to explore or sentences that make no sense to you. More than you, the words on this site is for my eyes.

However, you are free to poke around. Get a peek on what am working on or busy with. What's the best way to navigate this space you say? Well, that's to come. But you can start with [[my first note]] or my notes on this [[digital garden setup]]. From there, you can click on anything that you find interesting.

My idea is to move, have fun, and learn new something every day! ✌🏽

# Inspiring Quotes from Articles

Here are a few inspiring quotes from the articles that I've read.

> Writing is a subtle and nuanced craft. If you want people to read your words, it's on you to make it interesting and pleasing to their eyes and brains. Words have rhythm.
>

> Visualize your creativity as a backed-up pipe of water. The first mile is packed with wastewater. This wastewater must be emptied before the clear water arrives. … Let’s apply this to creativity: At the beginning of a writing session, write out every bad idea that unavoidably comes to mind. … Once the bad ideas are emptied, strong ideas begin to arrive.

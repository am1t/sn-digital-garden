# Experiements with Ruby on Rails

A placeholder where I plan to capture my notes with Ruby on Rails. I haven't got a sample project running. But I haven't explored much. 

Ruby though beffudles me with ways it can break, especially versions and dependency management. Though the framework concept with Rails looks promising, I don't think I have patience to fight a language anymore.

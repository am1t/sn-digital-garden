# Setting Up Digital Garden

As part of the whole [[digital garden]] exploration, one big point was how do I publish the thoughts and make them available on the web? For example, as referenced in [[my first note]]. Here are some references that I found onlien.

A beauty is this was written first in Notion and exported to Obsidian. I like that.

Uses Jekyll, Netlify and Obsidian. Possibly will follow this as part of my wish to get a digital garden setup. This was an easier setup -- I have got a running digital garden in place now. Idea is to explore this and see if this sticks.

One point that did fail was the local setup. My [[experiments with ruby|experiments with Ruby]] aren't going well. Here's what I have written during my experiments.

> This language beffudles me. It breaks at so many points, especially versions and dependency management.

It failed again. Some dependency could not be installed and I am sure it has got something to do with some version mismatch between Ruby's version

Another brilliant reference is this - listing down all the possible options - Jekyll (linked above), [Eleventy](https://github.com/binyamin/eleventy-garden) and Gatsby. Gatsby should be tricker. I will explore Jekyll and Eleventy.

Gatsby Garden is a brilliant theme, though. No doubt! And I love the [Gatsby Andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy) theme. Should I even go there? It looks to be a complex project. I have no clue how Gatsby works.  

A reference for getting started with Gatsby Andy.

**Update**: I did follow the starter video and tried to setup a gatsby based wiki. It is predominently the theme that inspired me. I wanted to have that. But the experiement failed, again mainly because there is a mismatch between the version of Gatsby that gets installed vs what the theme wants. Neither of the plugins used like the version that exists on my system. [[Versioning in dev]] is a terrible problem to solve.

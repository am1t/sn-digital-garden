# Exploring Digital Garden

The concept of digital gardens have always impressed me. I love what people do with such a space. Many use it as a wiki, a pool of what they learn. A few use it as scratchpad for their projects. Others use it just like a blog.

I like to think of this as a wiki -- another extension of the same concept is around second brain. Digital garden, for me, is garden of thoughts moved from the original (physical) brain to a digital space. Some are healthy. Others are just great to look at. Some are fully grown. Others are work in progress.

This space is to capture some more thoughts from others that I find. A place holder till then.

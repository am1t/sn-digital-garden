## Notes
> “It is only when you and I add the burden of those two awful eternities, yesterday and tomorrow, that we break down. It is not the experience of today that drives men mad. It is remorse or bitterness for something which happened yesterday or the dread of what tomorrow may bring. Let us therefore do our best to live but one day at a time.” ([Location 68](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07GNWXTKV&location=68))

## Notes
> Classic short stories usually track a few events that lead the character to gain a single important insight. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=175))

> Stories don’t show the audience the “real world”; they show the story world. The story world isn’t a copy of life as it is. It’s life as human beings imagine it could be. It is human life condensed and heightened so that the audience can gain a better understanding of how life itself works.

> theme, or what I call moral argument, is the brain of the story. Character is the heart and circulation system. Revelations are the nervous system. Story structure is the skeleton. Scenes are the skin. ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052Z3M8A&location=191))

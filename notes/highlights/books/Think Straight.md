## Notes
> Thoughts should serve a useful purpose. If they don’t, they’re useless. That’s straight thinking. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NJWFR3&location=262))

> Remember: Money is a replaceable resource. When you’re out of it, you can earn it back. You can’t say the same for time. Don’t spend too much time thinking about money. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B077NJWFR3&location=612))

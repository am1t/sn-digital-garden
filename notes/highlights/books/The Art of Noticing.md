## Notes
> ‘Everyone needs a mechanism to select what, out of all the things in the world, they should both look for and at, and what they should ignore’. That’s a search image – ‘the visual form of the expectation that allows you to find meaning in chaos’. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NZ9GPT5&location=169))

> Watch for: SECURITY CAMERAS ABANDONED PAY PHONES NEIGHBOURHOOD WATCH SIGNS ANYTHING NATURAL (A PLANT, A ROGUE BIRD) IN AIRPORTS LOCKSMITH STICKERS WEEDS EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH PLAQUES STRAY SHOPPING TROLLEYS STRAY TRAFFIC CONES ABANDONED BIKE LOCKS HAND-PAINTED SIGNS MOBILE PHONE TOWERS ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NZ9GPT5&location=197))

> You don’t have to wait for the next Slow Art Day to try this. It’s fun to spend such time with a work of art, but you can also look at five products at your local department store for ten minutes each. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NZ9GPT5&location=271))

> For starters, you can simply look up from your phone from time to time. Lift your eyes to what’s not right in front of you, but just above. ([Location 282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NZ9GPT5&location=282))

> Find a place to sit or lie down and look up. Take your time. See what’s up there. Then look for what’s beyond that. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NZ9GPT5&location=297))

> The determined repetition of the same view over time will likely reveal something that is not really the ‘same view’ after all. ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NZ9GPT5&location=302))

> This could be replicated with almost any image or object. Devote time to studying something you’ve seen before. You can look over and over – until, like Kennedy, you are seeing something in a way that nobody else could. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NZ9GPT5&location=340))

> Looking for an answer instead of the answer can shift and broaden your vision. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NZ9GPT5&location=466))

> The great benefit of drawing … is that when you look at something, you see it for the first time. And you can spend your life without ever seeing anything. ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NZ9GPT5&location=477))

> Practise this kind of openness to your environment. Look for flickers of human individuality amid the routine of the everyday. ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NZ9GPT5&location=597))

> it worries me greatly that today’s children can recognise 100 corporate logos and fewer than ten plants. ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NZ9GPT5&location=602))

> Put yourself on the lookout for the potentially interesting as you move through the world: on the Tube, at bus stops, on campuses, at work; in bowling alleys, parking lots, even prison yards. ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NZ9GPT5&location=642))

> Wherever we are, what we hear is mostly noise. When we ignore it, it disturbs us. When we listen to it, we find it fascinating. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07NZ9GPT5&location=665))

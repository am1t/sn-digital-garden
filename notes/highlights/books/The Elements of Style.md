## Notes
> Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all sentences short or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word tell. ([Location 90](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CW5XX6K&location=90))

> The colon has more effect than the comma, less power to separate than the semicolon, and more formality than the dash. ([Location 203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CW5XX6K&location=203))

> A dash is a mark of separation stronger than a comma, less formal than a colon, and more relaxed than parentheses. ([Location 215](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CW5XX6K&location=215))

> The difference between a verbal participle and a gerund is not always obvious, but note what is really said in each of the following. Do you mind me asking a question? Do you mind my asking a question? ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CW5XX6K&location=257))

> If your every sentence admits a doubt, your writing will lack authority. Save the auxiliaries would, should, could, may, might, and can for situations involving real uncertainty. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07CW5XX6K&location=334))

## Notes
> He was working hard at increasing his life span. He did it by cultivating boredom. Dunbar was working so hard at increasing his life span that Yossarian thought he was dead. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050OMJIW&location=328))

> The Texan turned out to be good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could stand him. ([Location 337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050OMJIW&location=337))

> The colonel had really been investigated. There was not an organ of his body that had not been drugged and derogated, dusted and dredged, fingered and photographed, removed, plundered and replaced. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050OMJIW&location=451))

> In between these two low points of his birth and his success lay thirty-one dismal years of loneliness and frustration. ([Location 1724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050OMJIW&location=1724))

> Major Major had been born too late and too mediocre. Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them. With Major Major it had been all three. ([Location 1725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0050OMJIW&location=1725))

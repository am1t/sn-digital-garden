## Notes
> Once you name something, it stops you seeing all of it, or why it matters. You focus on the word; which is just the tiniest part, really, the tip of an iceberg. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07G17DR4X&location=91))

> Somehow grasping at vanishing snowflakes is like grasping at happiness; an act of possession which instantly gives way to nothing. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07G17DR4X&location=262))

> The sun is low and red in a golden sky – the heath looks different in this light – darker shadows, brighter colours. The grass looks like it’s on fire, flickering flames under my feet. ([Location 752](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07G17DR4X&location=752))

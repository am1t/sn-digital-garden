## Notes
> The main problem was that on most topics I had no opinion whatsoever, and if I did have an opinion, I was so worried what others might think of that opinion I could barely remember what my opinion was in the presence of another human. ([Location 155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSAZ6ZU&location=155))

> I could have been floating in the blue hush of outer space and my mind still would’ve been blank. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSAZ6ZU&location=171))

> I did not die because we never do die in those moments when we come toe-to-toe with a version of ourselves that’s a fraction of the person we want to be. We just sniff a little and then quietly do the necessary adjustments to live within the fencing of our recalibrated limitations. ([Location 183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSAZ6ZU&location=183))

> there are stories that tell every sordid detail but still do not invoke the emotional complexity that makes a story so human: the moment of regret, the agony of a choice, the fact that you do still love your mother. ([Location 209](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSAZ6ZU&location=209))

> I wrote past the electric fence of reluctance. I’d burned up all my stalling time. I knew that if I were going to be a writer, I had to stop hiding. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSAZ6ZU&location=236))

> Type the words “This Is What I Think” in boldface at the top of a page and print out several copies. Use these pages for ten-minute timed writings. Try not to stop and edit during these timed writings but instead just let your thoughts pour onto the page. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSAZ6ZU&location=248))

> On the best days, you write with abandon, moving forward and forward and forward into you do not know what, jumping from rock to boulder, never once looking down at your feet. ([Location 260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSAZ6ZU&location=260))

> In theory, the teachings of Buddha seem pretty sound to me. Desire is the source of all suffering. Agreed! In theory, I could be a Buddhist. In real life there’s just one thing stopping me: my entire being. Buddhism is about detaching. That’s great, but my twenty-three-year-old self was all about latching on, clinging, and whimpering. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00BSAZ6ZU&location=284))

> Writing requires trust: trust that words will find you, that the unknown will become known, that the mystery will be solved, that the story will find its arc, that you will find your story and your voice, that your voice will be heard, that you will be understood. But most of all, writing requires you to trust yourself, the source of the voice inside you that supplies the next word, the next line, the next idea. And until you can access some of this trust, you won’t be able to write the stories you want to write the way you want to write them.

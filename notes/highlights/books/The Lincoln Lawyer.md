## Notes
> I hate being inside a jail. I’m not sure why. I guess it’s because sometimes the line seems so thin. The line between being a criminal attorney and a criminal attorney. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00374720W&location=259))

> The law was a large, rusting machine that sucked up people and lives and money. I was just a mechanic. I had become expert at going into the machine and fixing things and extracting what I needed from it in return. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00374720W&location=410))

> High-priced family lawyers were usually seen by prosecutors as nothing more than ass wipers for the rich and famous. ([Location 770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00374720W&location=770))

> Freeway traffic in Los Angeles was as mysterious as marriage. It moved and flowed, then stalled and stopped for no easily explainable reason. ([Location 806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00374720W&location=806))

> He said the scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client. Because if you fuck up and he goes to prison, it’ll scar you for life.” ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00374720W&location=1429))

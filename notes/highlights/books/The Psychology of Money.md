> There is a paradox here: people tend to want wealth to signal to others that they should be liked and admired. But in reality those other people often bypass admiring you, not because they don’t think wealth is admirable, but because they use your wealth as a benchmark for their own desire to be liked and admired. ([Location 1067](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1067))

> Spreadsheets are good at telling you when the numbers do or don’t add up.

([Location 1575](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1575))

> the first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily. ([Location 1694](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1694))

> Aiming, at every point in your working life, to have moderate annual savings, moderate free time, no more than a moderate commute, and at least moderate time with your family, increases the odds of being able to stick with a plan and avoid regret than if any one of those things fall to the extreme sides of the spectrum. ([Location 1713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08FHZ5L47&location=1713))

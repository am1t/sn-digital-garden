## Notes
> According to the New York Times, the average person’s daily consumption of information now adds up to a remarkable 34 gigabytes.1 A separate study cited by the Times estimates that we consume the equivalent of 174 full newspapers’ worth of content each and every day, five times higher than in 1986.2 ([Location 235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=235))

> Information Overload has become Information Exhaustion, taxing our mental resources and leaving us constantly anxious that we’re forgetting something. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=239))

> Every bit of energy we spend straining to recall things is energy not spent doing the thinking that only humans can do: ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=251))

> Instead of consuming ever-greater amounts of content, we could take on a more patient, thoughtful approach that favors rereading, reformulating, and working through the implications of ideas over time. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=277))

> This digital commonplace book is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas. ([Location 288](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=288))

> your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solitude before sharing it with others. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=292))

> There are four essential capabilities that we can rely on a Second Brain to perform for us: Making our ideas concrete. Revealing new associations between ideas. Incubating our ideas over time. Sharpening our unique perspectives. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=457))

> creativity is about connecting ideas together, especially ideas that don’t seem to be connected. ([Location 480](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=480))

> The more diverse and unusual the material you put into it in the first place, the more original the connections that will emerge. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=491))

> Sebastian Junger once wrote on the subject of “writer’s block”: “It’s not that I’m blocked. It’s that I don’t have enough research to write with power and knowledge about that topic. It always means, not that I can’t find the right words, [but rather] that I don’t have the ammunition.”7 ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=516))

> It’s not about having the perfect tools—it’s about having a reliable set of tools you can depend on, ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=552))

> “CODE”—Capture; Organize; Distill; Express. ([Location 584](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=584))

> We need to adopt the perspective of a curator, stepping back from the raging river and starting to make intentional decisions about what information we want to fill our minds. ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=602))

> The best way to organize your notes is to organize for action, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its utility, asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?” ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=627))

> Think of yourself not just as a taker of notes, but as a giver of notes—you are giving your future self the gift of knowledge that is easy to find and understand. ([Location 652](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=652))

> Innovation and impact don’t happen by accident or chance. Creativity depends on a creative process. ([Location 764](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=764))

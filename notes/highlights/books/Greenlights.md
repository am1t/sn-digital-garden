## Notes
> A denied expectation hurts more than a denied hope, while a fulfilled hope makes us happier than a fulfilled expectation. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=270))

> Hope’s got a higher return on happiness and less debit on denial, it’s just not as measurable. ([Location 271](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=271))

> Alone in this foreign country, on my own in this uncomfortable world, I took responsibility for who I was and what I believed in. I made a judgment, and I chose. I did not need reassurance, and the clarity gave me identity. I was not going to lose my anchor, both on principle and in order to survive. ([Location 926](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=926))

> We cannot fully appreciate the light without the shadows. We have to be thrown off balance to find our footing. It’s better to jump than fall. And here I am. ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=1023))

> The sooner we become less impressed with our life, our accomplishments, our career, our relationships, the prospects in front of us—the sooner we become less impressed and more involved with these things—the sooner we get better at them. ([Location 1308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=1308))

> We have to prepare to have freedom. We have to do the work to then do the job. We have to prepare for the job so we can be free to do the work. ([Location 1592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=1592))

> Sometimes we don’t need advice. Sometimes we just need to hear we’re not the only one. ([Location 1711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=1711))

> Neither of us anxious to fill the quiet gaps. The silence wasn’t awkward, it was golden. ([Location 2520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=2520))

> Being surrounded by senior citizens will remind you of your mortality and make you feel younger at the same time. You see their bodies not doing what their minds tell them to do and their minds forgetting what they know to remember, yet they’re anything but sentimental about it. ([Location 2647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=2647))

> A sense of humor helped me cope, a strong woman by my side kept me steadfast, and an infant son and newborn daughter to raise kept me busy. ([Location 2781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=2781))

> It’s hard to find constants, natural laws, universal truths in life, but when we have kids, there is no intellectual discussion or philosophy as to how or how much to love, protect, and guide them, it’s an instinctual commitment, an immediate, infinite, and ever-growing responsibility. A privilege. ([Location 3073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=3073))

> All Lives couldn’t matter until Black Lives matter more. ([Location 3082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=3082))

> Relatively, we are livin. Life is our résumé. It is our story to tell, and the choices we make write the chapters. Can we live in a way where we look forward to looking back? ([Location 3104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=3104))

> Inevitably, we are going to die. Our eulogy, our story, will be told by others and forever introduce us when we are gone. ([Location 3106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=3106))

> The Soul Objective. Begin with the end in mind. ([Location 3107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08DFKSZDF&location=3107))

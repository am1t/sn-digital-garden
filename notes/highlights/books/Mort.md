## Notes
> It was hard to drown in the Ankh, but easy to suffocate. ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000W967UQ&location=854))

> PEOPLE CAN’T EXPECT TO HAVE ME RUNNING AROUND AFTER THEM ALL THE TIME. ([Location 930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000W967UQ&location=930))

> Mort was already aware that love made you feel hot and cold and cruel and weak, but he hadn’t realized that it could make you stupid. ([Location 1814](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000W967UQ&location=1814))

> History unravels gently, like an old sweater. It has been patched and darned many times, reknitted to suit different people, shoved in a box under the sink of censorship to be cut up for the dusters of propaganda, yet it always—eventually—manages to spring back into its old familiar shape. History has a habit of changing the people who think they are changing it. ([Location 1833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000W967UQ&location=1833))

> His lips moved soundlessly. Little beads of sweat sprang up on his forehead and decided to get together and go down and see what his nose was doing. His eyes watered. ([Location 2171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000W967UQ&location=2171))

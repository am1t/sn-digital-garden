## Notes
> At twilight thick, fluffy snowflakes spiraled out of the low sky, and the people of Denver huddled in expectation of a Rocky Mountain blizzard. By ten o’clock that night, a bitterly cold gale blew in from the west, howling out of the mountain passes and shrieking down those rugged, wooded slopes. The snowflakes grew smaller, until they were as fine as sand, and they sounded as abrasive as sand, too, when the wind blew them across the windows of Dr. Paul Markwell’s book-lined study.

> ‘Envy, Bob. Envy eats them alive. If you had money, they’d envy you that. But since you don’t, they envy you for having such a good, bright, loving daughter. They envy you for just being a happy man. They envy you for not envying them. One of the greatest sorrows of human existence is that some people aren’t happy merely to be alive but find their happiness only in the misery of others.’ ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A3BO8UO&location=522))

> Intimacy, total surrender of self, and the sense of shared hopes and dreams and destinies had been the true medicines; the great, good feeling of family that she had with him was a talisman that effectively warded off cold fate.

> ‘Adversity breeds toughness, and the tough succeed. And survive.’ ([Location 2916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A3BO8UO&location=2916))

> “Nothing the world does to me can ever get me so far down that I can’t be silly and frivolous.” ([Location 3348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A3BO8UO&location=3348))

> The pain of his wound wrung streams of sweat from him, yet he was shivering in the bitter January cold, too dizzy to stand up, yet terrified of sitting down and falling into an endless sleep. ([Location 3448](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00A3BO8UO&location=3448))

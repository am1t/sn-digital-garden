## Notes
> One of my sister Dori’s cheesy jokes sprang to mind. Guns don’t kill people. People with mustaches kill people. ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H5BZUNY&location=703))

> People like Angela are why we put our armor on when we go to work, I thought. That armor might be professionalism, or a nice business suit, or even some thick black mascara. We want a barrier between the ‘real us’ and the person we need to be at work. Usually that’s enough to get us through the day, but sometimes it isn’t.

> but the rubber duck I’d been talking to wasn’t half so intimidating. ([Location 1862](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H5BZUNY&location=1862))

> Insult me if you will, I thought, but no one threatens my cat. ([Location 2060](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00H5BZUNY&location=2060))

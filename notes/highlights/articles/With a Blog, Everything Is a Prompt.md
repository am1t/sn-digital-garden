## Notes
> A blog also feels like a safer place to write than social media; it’s a space I control, I’m not constrained by character count so I can add nuance, and it’s less subject to context collapse given the formats readers consume it (directly or via RSS). Sure, I reach fewer people, but virality is not something I want ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvm1dz6mx57g2ahrctf2m965))

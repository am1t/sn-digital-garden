## Notes
> Writing reinforces my thoughts. It won't be a stretch to say that I understand my thoughts only through [#writing](https://amitg.blog/tag:writing). Distil them. Before that, they are just fuzzy noises in my head. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy1cgnxtcs97chtv0rzkr6v6))

> If you're thinking *about* writing, you only think you're writing.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy1cgtm8kn7cb5k2vr6yv6a7))

> I often have such phases when for every inspiration on why I should write, my mind comes up with a hundred distractions about why I shouldn't. The only way I have known not to fall for the lure of distractions is through the routine of fixed time and place for me to write.

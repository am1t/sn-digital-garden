- Document Note: This text discusses the breakdown of Twitter and how it was an abomination before God, like the Tower of Babel. It suggests that God was protecting us from ourselves by destroying Twitter, and posits that people are now finding their tribes in the decentralized web apps of the Fediverse. It questions how these smaller groups of happier people will be monetized and concludes by suggesting that though everything will centralize again and it will seem eternal, for now people should enjoy the scattering.

## Notes
> The Fediverse apps are all built on a set of rules called the ActivityPub standard, which is a little like HTML had sex with a calendar invite. It’s a content polycule ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsjdzfvpyhgk47b4yfqghcar))

> How will these smaller groups of happier people be monetized? This is a tough question for the billionaires. Happy people, the kind who eat sandwiches together, are boring. They don’t buy much. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsje0nz2t53szvqex8ntxn6j))

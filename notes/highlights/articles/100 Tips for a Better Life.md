## Notes
> Things you use for a significant fraction of your life (bed: 1/3rd, office-chair: 1/4th) are worth investing in. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwb7eerwvdwygjbw0ph9pp58))

> When buying things, time and money trade-off against each other. If you’re low on money, take more time to find deals. If you’re low on time, stop looking for great deals and just buy things quickly online. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwb7gfsswdd79nm6snqv6h9x))

> Done is better than perfect ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwb7kgq1qm1drexxt8ztedcb))

> Discipline is superior to motivation. The former can be trained, the latter is fleeting. You won’t be able to accomplish great things if you’re only relying on motivation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwb7ph3z6ady97zywndtz66f))

> Make accomplishing things as easy as possible. Find the easiest way to start exercising. Find the easiest way to start writing. People make things harder than they have to be and get frustrated when they can’t succeed. Try not to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwb7r5ycw899wpmvymxq6dfd))

> Don’t confuse ‘doing a thing because I like it’ with ‘doing a thing because I want to be seen as the sort of person who does such things’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwb7wsr80kzhvx7b8cg7s5zm))

> Sturgeon’s law states that 90% of everything is crap. If you dislike poetry, or fine art, or anything, it’s possible you’ve only ever seen the crap. Go looking! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwb87bpqvhhxdtp7bdq2agca))

> There’s some evidence that introverts and extroverts both benefit from being pushed to be more extroverted. Consider this the next time you aren’t sure if you feel like going out. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwb8940zkdqqm3rzfnmekmsa))

## Notes
> It is natural, I suppose, that a great library should be a more important presence in the life of a writer than it is for those whose work does not involve constant contact with the written word. My old calendars tell me that I have certainly spent more time in this building during the last three decades than anywhere but in my own apartment.

> The name New York Public Library is somewhat misleading, at least as far as the financing of the four research libraries is concerned. While the neighborhood branch libraries, with circulating collections, are publicly financed, the great research collections are largely supported by private philanthropy. Less than one-third of the budget for the research centers comes from public sources.

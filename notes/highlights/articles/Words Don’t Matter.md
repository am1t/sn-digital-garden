## Notes
> Words strain, 
> Crack and Sometimes break, under the burden, 
> Under the tension, slip slide and perish, 
> Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place, 
> Will not stay still. 
> —T.S. Eliot ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvkyhkzhtawygvj7n21jk0n4))

> The pen may be more powerful than the sword, but only if the words reach a receptive audience ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvkymxx35337gpcmnmjge5sw))

> Without context and interpretation, and unless one chooses to internalize them, words are impotent, and that gives us power over them, not vice versa. We may be influenced by what we read or hear, but we own our responses, including our actions, which, after all, speak louder than words ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvkysacmbjfprp15bc4qf9tc))

> Words themselves can be the greatest tools to alter the impacts of other words. After all, words aren’t, or shouldn’t be, treated as if they are sacred. Allowing them to be said out loud often robs them of their power ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvkz0hcg4zq2g4w4dc34d0ft))

> They really, in themselves, have no power. It’s the thrust of the sentence that makes them either good or bad ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gvkz2rsad1exy1mnmw46rh5m))
    - Note: A quote by comedian George Carlin while talking about words. They in themselves have no power. They get power in a sentence.

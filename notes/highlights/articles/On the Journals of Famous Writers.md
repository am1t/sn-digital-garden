## Notes
> “In the journal,” she wrote, “I do not just express myself more openly than I could to any person; I create myself.”

> “What sort of diary should I like mine to be?” asked Virginia Woolf. “Something loose knit and yet not slovenly, so elastic that it will embrace anything, solemn, slight or beautiful that comes into my mind.”

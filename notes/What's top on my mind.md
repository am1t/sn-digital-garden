# What's top of my mind. Now.

An inspired /now page [originally proposed](https://sivers.org/nowff) by Derek Sivers, this note holds my thoughts log, presented as a simple bulleted list.

- I am still working from home, but the days look numbered. There is growing discontent among the decision-makers.

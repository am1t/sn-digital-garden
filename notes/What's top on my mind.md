# What's top of my mind. Now.

An inspired /now page [originally proposed](https://sivers.org/nowff) by Derek Sivers, this note holds my thoughts log, presented as a simple bulleted list. I intend to update this frequently, hopefully once a week. I have learnt from experience that if anything is more complicated, I would be unable to keep up.

### What Have I Been Focused on?

- Load the wiki with my [[book notes]] and a few other thoughts on articles. Some may not be directly linked, but available through search.
- Curbing my excitement for digital sketchnotes. Trying to convince self that I do not have time for this.
- A [lot of](https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/10/16/anatole-a-twocolumn.html) [dev projects](https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/10/20/since-i-moved.html). Currently, cultivating my [[digital garden]]. I am moving my notes from all the places into a single location. Both at work and off work. The small wins help.
- Build my [[productivity system]]. As much as the p-word is hated, I need a process to manage the sheer amount of tasks vying for my attention.
- I am writing regularly and following a routine of early mornings without fail. I log on to my system every morning and read & write. I am also writing [quick](https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/10/14/i-love-technology.html) [short](https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/10/17/having-more-choices.html) [posts](https://www.amitgawande.com/2022/10/19/being-favourite-vs.html) around an idea.
- I am still working from home, but the days look numbered. There is growing discontent among the decision-makers.

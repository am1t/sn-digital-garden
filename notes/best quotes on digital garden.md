# Quotes on Digital Garden 

Here are some of the best quotes, description or tangential thoughts on and around the concept of digital gardens. Again, no structure. Adding as things no.

***Joel Hooks in My blog is a digital garden***

> Like with real gardens, our digital gardens are a constant ebb and flow towards entropy. Weeds take over. Left untended the Earth will reclaim what belongs to it. The same is true for our digital gardens here on the internet.

> It is a blog, sure, but it is also a wiki. It's a spot where I can post ideas, snippets, resources, thoughts, collections, and other bits and pieces that I find interesting and useful. Instead of always being a "performance" level of blogging, it can be a looser more human endeavor that drops the idea of robots sorting the content (in this case simply by date created) and embraces the idea of curation, by me, for you.

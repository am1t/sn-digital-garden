# Hi, I am Amit! 👋🏽

## Welcome to my second brain 🌱

You've stumbled onto my wiki. There are other trending names for such a space, [[digital garden]] 🌱 or second brain 🧠. So, call it what you like. I use this site for capturing my unformed thoughts, scribbles or notes if you like, hence the title.

  Take a look at my first note to see where I started with this space.

You are free to poke around. Get a peek on what am working on or busy with. What's the best way to navigate this space you say? Well, that's to come. But you can start with [[my first note]] or my notes on this [[digital garden setup]]. From there, you can click on anything that you find interesting.

My idea is to move, have fun, and learn new something every day! ✌🏽

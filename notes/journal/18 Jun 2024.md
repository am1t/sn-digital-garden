- Obsidian looks to be a great option for capturing notes. What I find tricky is why did I not use this ever earlier. Another aspect I need to consider is if I can replicate this in Notion. Why notion? Because that can be used across devices.
- I don't know why, but I can't fully utilize the day. What's the best way to do it? Basically the problem is I cannot timebox things I am doing. I need more time to work on anything, which isn't right.
- I published a [new post on resting](https://amitg.blog/post/on-resting) just now. Today has felt so long because I have not wasted it. I didn’t watch anything. I have just been catching up on stuff. A lot of it. It’s so relaxing to experience feeling of achievement. Such has been my state recently that even writing a small post is a win.

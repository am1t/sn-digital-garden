# Book Notes

Sumary and detailed notes from all the books I read. I want to make this a practise and a habit. So currently there is no structure, no order to any of this. My idea is to build this as Derek Siver's does with the books he reads. I eventually want to reach there. But till then, it's a huge work in progress.

This [FAQ from Sivers](https://sive.rs/bfaq) is really helpful. Especially this quote, "When I’m reading and come across a surprising or inspiring idea, I save it. That’s all my notes are. I’m not summarizing the book. **I’m just saving ideas for myself, for later reflection.**"

**Notes aren't summary.** They are just ideas I like.

## 100 WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR WRITING by Gary Provost

> This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.

> Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.

> So write with a combination of short, medium, and long sentences. Create a sound that pleases the reader’s ear. Don’t just write words. Write music.”

# Productivity System

A work in progress currently. I am still working on puting a process in place. Overall though, here's what I would like to have.

- Ways to stay organized
- Manage tasks - add, prioritize and track
- Quick capture of ideas/thoughts as they arrive

Usually, I would need a notebook/notes, calendar and todo apps and cloud storage. Currently, here's what I am looking at.

- Tick Tick for managing my task.
- Notion to manage all the types of notes online
- Obsidian to convert them into deeper thoughts and references
